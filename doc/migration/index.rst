Polybar Migration Guides
========================

Updating polybar to the newest version often requires updating your
configuration files to use the newest features and replace outdated settings.

Starting from version 3.7, we include a small guide here for how to migrate
from the previous version.
If you are upgrading over multiple versions (e.g. from 3.5 to 3.7), also read
the migration guides for all versions in between.

For migration guides before version 3.7, please look at our `release blog posts
<https://polybar.github.io/blog/>`_.

When upgrading make sure to run polybar from the terminal and look for errors,
warnings, and deprecation messages.
This can save you a lot of issues in the future when deprecated settings and
features are removed.
