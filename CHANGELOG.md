# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Each release should have the following subsections, if entries exist, in the
given order: `Breaking`, `Build`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Added`, `Changed`,
`Fixed`, `Security`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Breaking
- We added the backslash escape character (\\) for configuration values. This
  means that the literal backslash character now has special meaning in
  configuration files, therefore if you want to use it in a value as a literal
  backslash, you need to escape it with the backslash escape character. The
  parser logs an error if any unescaped backslashes are found in a value. This
  affects you only if you are using two consecutive backslashes in a value,
  which will now be interpreted as a single literal backslash.
  [`#2354`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2354)
- We rewrote our tag parser. This shouldn't break anything, if you experience
  any problems, please let us know.
  The new parser now gives errors for certain invalid tags where the old parser
  would just silently ignore them. Adding extra text to the end of a valid tag
  now produces an error. For example, tags like `%{T-a}`, `%{T2abc}`, `%{rfoo}`,
  and others will now start producing errors.
  This does not affect you unless you are producing your own formatting tags
  (for example in a script) and you are using one of these invalid tags.
- For security reasons, the named pipe at `/tmp/polybar_mqueue.<PID>` had its
  permission bits changed from `666` to `600` to prevent sending ipc messages
  to polybar processes running under a different user.

### Build
- New dependency: [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv). At least version 1.3
  is required.
- Bump the minimum cmake version to 3.5
- The `BUILD_IPC_MSG` option has been renamed to `BUILD_POLYBAR_MSG`
- Building the documentation is now enabled by default and not just when
  `sphinx-build` is found.
- Users can control exactly which targets should be available with the following
  cmake options (together with their default value):
  - `BUILD_POLYBAR=ON` - Builds the `polybar` executable
  - `BUILD_POLYBAR_MSG=ON` - Builds the `polybar-msg` executable
  - `BUILD_TESTS=OFF` - Builds the test suite
  - `BUILD_DOC=ON` - Builds the documentation
  - `BUILD_DOC_HTML=BUILD_DOC` - Builds the html documentation (depends on `BUILD_DOC`)
  - `BUILD_DOC_MAN=BUILD_DOC` - Builds the manpages (depends on `BUILD_DOC`)
  - `BUILD_CONFIG=ON` - Generates the default config
  - `BUILD_SHELL=ON` - Generates shell completion files
  - `DISABLE_ALL=OFF` - Disables all above targets by default. Individual
    targets can still be enabled explicitly.
- The documentation can no longer be built by directly configuring the `doc`
  directory.
- The sample config file is now placed in the `generated-sources` folder inside
  whatever folder you invoked `cmake` from instead of in the root folder of the
  repository.
- The `POLYBAR_FLAGS` cmake variable can be used to pass extra C++ compiler flags.
- The sample config file has been removed.
- Polybar now ships a default config that is installed to
  `/etc/polybar/config.ini`, it lives in `doc/config.ini`.
  It will also be placed in the `examples` directory in the documentation folder.
  [`#2405`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2405)
- The `userconfig` target has been removed, you can no longer use `make
  userconfig`. As an alternative, you can copy the default config from
  `/etc/polybar/config.ini`.

### Deprecated
- `[settings]`: `throttle-output` and `throttle-output-for` have been removed.
  The new event loop already does a similar thing where it coalesces update
  triggers if they happen directly after one another, leading to only a single
  bar update.
- When not specifying the config file with `--config`, naming your config file
  `config` is deprecated. Rename your config file to `config.ini`.
- Directly writing ipc messages to `/tmp/polybar_mqueue.<PID>` is deprecated,
  users should always use `polybar-msg`. As a consequence the message format
  used for IPC is deprecated as well.
- `polybar-msg hook` is deprecated in favor of using the hook action.
  `polybar-msg` will tell you the correct command to use.

### Removed
- `DEBUG_SHADED` cmake variable and its associated functionality.

### Added

  or pixels could be specified.

### Changed
- Polybar now also reads `config.ini` when searching for config files.
  ([`#2323`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2323))
- Polybar additionally searches in `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/polybar` (or
  `/etc/xdg/polybar` if it is not set) and `/etc/polybar` for config files
  (only `config.ini`).
  ([`#2016`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2016))
- We rewrote polybar's main event loop. This shouldn't change any behavior for
  the user, but be on the lookout for X events, click events, or ipc messages
  not arriving and the bar not shutting down/restarting properly and let us
  know if you find any issues.
- Slight changes to the value ranges the different ramp levels are responsible
  for in the cpu, memory, fs, and battery modules. The first and last level are
  only used for everything at or below and at and above the edges of the value
  range, respectively. The other levels are evenly distributed over the value
  range as before.
- `custom/script`: `interval` now defaults to 0 if `tail = true` as per the
  documentation.
- `internal/network`:
  - Increased precision for upload and download speeds: 0 decimal places for
    KB/s (as before), 1 for MB/s and 2 for GB/s.
- Clicks arriving in close succession, no longer get dropped. Before polybar
  would drop any click that arrived within 5ms of the previous one.
- Increased the double click interval from 150ms to 400ms.
- Stop ignoring actions if they arrive while the previous one hasn't been processed yet.
  ([`#2469`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2469))
- Polybar can now be run without passing the bar name as argument given that
  the configuration file only defines one bar
  ([`#2525`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2525))
- `include-directory` and `include-file` now support relative paths. The paths
  are relative to the folder of the file where those directives appear.
  ([`#2523`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2523))
- `custom/ipc`: Empty output strings are no longer formatted. This prevents
  extraneous spaces and separators from appearing in the bar when the output of
  an ipc module is empty.

### Fixed
- `custom/script`: Concurrency issues with fast-updating tailed scripts.
  ([`#1978`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/1978))
- Trailing space after the layout label when indicators are empty and made sure right amount
  of spacing is added between the indicator labels, in the xkeyboard module.
  ([`#2292`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2292))
- Parser error if click command contained `}`
  ([`#2040`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2040))
- Slight imprecision when calculating percentages. This caused the volume
  reported by alsa to be off by one.
  ([`#2399`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2399))
- `internal/backlight`: With amdgpu backlights, the brightness indicator was slightly behind.
  ([`#2367`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2367))
- Warning message regarding T@ in bspwm module
  ([`#2371`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2371))
- `polybar -m` used to show both physical outputs and randr monitors, even if the outputs were covered by monitors.
  ([`#2481`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2481))
- `internal/xworkspaces`:
  - Broken scroll-wrapping and order of workspaces when scrolling
    ([`#2491`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2491))
  - Module would error if WM was not full started up.
    ([`#1915`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/1915))
- `internal/network`: The module now properly supports 'altnames' for
  interfaces.
- `internal/battery`: More accurate battery state
([`#2563`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2563))
- Some modules stop updating when system time moves backwards. ([`#857`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/857), [`#1932`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/1932))

### Build
- Don't use `git` when building documentation ([`#2309`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2309))
